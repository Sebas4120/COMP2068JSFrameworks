                <h2> ðŸŽ“ Background</h2>
                <p>
                   I studied at the University of Lima where I obtained a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in business management and supply chain management. During my studies, I learned how to improve industrial processes, create a company, design industrial plants, process simulation, logistics management and computer programming. </p>
                   
                <p>I obtained my engineering degree thanks to my thesis research in Peru on data analysis and results of logistics management in pharmaceutical companies. Thanks to the success of the research, together with my thesis partner Valeria Wong, we presented the thesis at the International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management (IJIMT) in the UK in 2023 and published the paper in the International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology (IJIMT) the same year.
