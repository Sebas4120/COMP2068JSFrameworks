      <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
      <p>My name is Sebastian Helmuth Aguirre Manrique. I have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from Universidad de Lima and I am currently in my last semester of my graduate studies in Computer Programming at Georgian College with a cumulative GPA of 91. ✍🏻</p>

      <p>
      My work experience during and after leaving university allowed me to find my passion for programming and business and data analytics. I live in Barrie, Ontario in Canada where I gained my last work experience as a Data Analyst & Technician at York Region. Currently, I am dedicated to improving my analytical skills and looking for a permanent position as a data or business analyst.📈
